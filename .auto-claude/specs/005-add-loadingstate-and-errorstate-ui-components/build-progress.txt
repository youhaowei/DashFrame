## Key Patterns Identified
- EmptyState pattern uses sizeConfig for sm/md/lg variants
- cn utility from lib/utils for class merging
- LucideIcon type from lib/icons
- Accessibility: role="status", aria-live="polite"
- Button from primitives/button for actions
- Stories use @storybook/nextjs-vite, layout: "centered", tags: ["autodocs"]

## Icons Available
- LoaderIcon (LuLoader) - for spinner animation
- AlertCircleIcon (LuCircleAlert) - for error icon
- RefreshIcon (LuRefreshCw) - for retry action
