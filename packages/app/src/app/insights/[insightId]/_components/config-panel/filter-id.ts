 * Identity for a stored filter that predates persisted ids.
 *
 * Derived from the predicate's own content, never from array position, and
 * never freshly generated: hydration runs again on every refetch, so a random
 * id would differ between the list a dialog was opened from and the list its
 * save merges into — `applyFilterSave` would miss and append a duplicate,
 * which is the exact misroute persisted ids exist to prevent. Content is the
 * only source that is stable across both a refetch and a reorder.
 *
 * Byte-identical predicates must still get distinct identities. They remain
 * separate list entries, and editing or removing one of them is not the same
 * operation as doing it to both — `applyFilterSave` replaces every `_id` match
 * and `handleRemoveFilter` drops every match, so a shared identity would edit
 * or delete the pair. The occurrence index among *identical* predicates
 * disambiguates them: it is an ordinal within the identical group, not a
 * position in the array, so it survives a plain refetch and any reordering.
 *
 * What it does NOT survive is a change in how many identical twins exist. If a
 * concurrent write inserts or deletes one between the dialog opening and its
 * save, the surviving twins renumber, the save's `_id` matches nothing, and
 * `applyFilterSave` appends it as a new filter instead of updating the one the
 * user edited. That window is only reachable for rows stored before filters
 * carried ids, and only for byte-identical duplicates; a persisted `id` closes
 * it, which is what saving any such row does. Tracked as issue #309.
 *
 * The `legacy:` prefix keeps these distinguishable from persisted ids, which
 * are UUIDs. Saving such a row promotes this value to its persisted `id`.
